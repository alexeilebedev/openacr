## About

The home for this project is at https://github.com/alexeilebedev/openacr

This is OpenACR, an open-source version of acr and amc, powerful
and extensible tools for creating programs and writing code as data.

It is the result of over 10 years of development and
production use. The tools were initially written with the goal of formalizing
construction of low-latency & realtime programs,
but they ended up being suitable for all sorts of other things, and the code generation
part took on a life of its own, eventually generating most of its own source code.

Since the tools are domain-agnostic, it was decided that open-sourcing
them would be the best way to ensure their longevity and value, and
also a way to give back to the community. After
all, if it weren't for other open-source projects like Linux, gcc and the shell, 
this project wouldn't have been possible in the first place. And so here we are.

OpenACR is in an interesting position of having been co-developed in connection with a large
software project, and later extracted back from it. Its usability
on small projects is assumed but not proven. I believe its ideal use case is realized
when it is taken as a kernel, and an ecosystem of commands and corresponding
configuration data files are grown in-place around it. Thus, it is meant to be used
a core of a project.

Enjoy,
