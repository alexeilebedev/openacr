## About
<a href="#about"></a>
This is OpenACR, a meta-programming language for generative systems programming.
It consists of a powerful and extensible set of tools for creating programs and meta-algorithms,
and writing code as data. OpenACR is published at [https://github.com/alexeilebedev/openacr](https://github.com/alexeilebedev/openacr)

It is the result of over 15 years of development and
production use. The tools were initially written with the goal of formalizing
construction of large mission criticial programs,
but they ended up being suitable for all sorts of other things, and the code generation
part took on a life of its own, eventually generating most of its own source code.

OpenACR was co-developed in connection with a large, mission critical software project of national scale.
OpenACR was first published in 2019, and is being actively maintained.
The ideal use case is realized when it is taken as a kernel, and an ecosystem of commands and corresponding
configuration data files are grown in-place around it. Thus, it is meant to be used as a core of a project.
