## Testimonials

These are some of the good things people have said about acr/amc.

### 1

    Alexei has built a tool set and framework that significantly improves
    the software development process with large percentage of the code
    generated with guaranteed consistency and quality.

### 2

    Alexei's ACR and AMC is a unique, transformative, and extendible tool
    that models and implements the relationships between data,
    configurations, components, and anything else that can be defined. The
    code that it generates leads to reduced development efforts, improved
    quality, excellent performance, and a single coding standard across
    the entire codebase.

    Alexei has created a paradigm-shifting methodology for systems that
    require extreme stability while having a high-frequency release
    cycle. His model compiler in combination with pre-commit invariant
    checking has enabled a big team of developers to produce very
    high-quality products in very short periods of time while working on a
    single codebase

    Alexei envisioned a new HPC programming paradigm, wrote a programming
    language and compiler for it, and invented middleware with a
    blockchain-like transactional algorithm. The resulting unique and
    powerful programming environment, that I have the privilege using at
    AlgoEngineering and NYSE, formed the foundation for NYSE Pillar
    exchange architecture. NYSE Pillar currently powers 4 markets, with
    more on the way.
